Tried to replicate Twitter in simple manners with a simple HTML GUI (JeekJeek)

A social network (JeekJeek) was designed, capable of signing up new users; Tweeting (Jeeking) text, hashtags, and mentions; Searching 
users by username and searching for hashtags; Commenting on Jeeks and replying to comments and other replies; ReJeeking existing Jeeks;
Liking and disliking Jeeks; And following other users. Notifications are also included.
Jeek, comments and replies could also be shown in detail.

The GUI runs on a local server (APHTTP Server was used).
